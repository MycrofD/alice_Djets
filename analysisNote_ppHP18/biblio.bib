	Abstract = {The production of prompt charmed mesons D0, D+ and D∗+, and their antiparticles, was measured with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair,                                                                                                                                                                       s                                                      N                            N                                                                                                                                {\$}{\$} {\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}NN{\}}{\}}{\}} {\$}{\$}                , of 2.76 TeV. The production yields for rapidity |y| < 0.5 are presented as a function of transverse momentum, p                                T, in the interval 1--36 GeV/c for the centrality class 0--10{\%} and in the interval 1--16 GeV/c for the centrality class 30--50{\%}. The nuclear modification factor R                                AA was computed using a proton-proton reference at                                                                                                                                             s                                            =                      2.76                                                        {\$}{\$} {\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=2.76 {\$}{\$}                 TeV, based on measurements at                                                                                                                                             s                                            =                      7                                                        {\$}{\$} {\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=7 {\$}{\$}                 TeV and on theoretical calculations. A maximum suppression by a factor of 5-6 with respect to binary-scaled pp yields is observed for the most central collisions at p                                T of about 10 GeV/c. A suppression by a factor of about 2-3 persists at the highest p                                T covered by the measurements. At low p                                T (1-3 GeV/c), the R                                AA has large uncertainties that span the range 0.35 (factor of about 3 suppression) to 1 (no suppression). In all p                                T intervals, the R                                AA is larger in the 30-50{\%} centrality class compared to central collisions. The D-meson R                                AA is also compared with that of charged pions and, at large p                                T, charged hadrons, and with model calculations.                                                                                                    },

We perform this calculation using various IR regulators and show explicitly how the IR divergences cancel in the matching. We derive the relationship between the coefficients                   {\$} {\{}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}J{\}}{\_}{\{}ij{\}}{\}} {\$}                 and the quark and gluon jet functions.

In our analysis we sum the logarithms of $\tau$ = 1-T in the cross section to next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NNLL).

	Abstract = {We define and study the properties of generalized beam functions (BFs) and fragmenting jet functions (FJFs), which are fully-unintegrated parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs) for perturbative k                ⊥. We calculate at one loop the coefficients for matching them onto standard PDFs and FFs, correcting previous results for the BFs in the literature. Technical subtleties when measuring transverse momentum in dimensional regularization are clarified, and this enables us to renormalize in momentum space. Generalized BFs describe the distribution in the full four-momentum k                                  $\mu$                 of a colliding parton taken out of an initial-state hadron, and therefore characterize the collinear initial-state radiation. We illustrate their importance through a factorization theorem for pp{\thinspace}{\textrightarrow}{\thinspace}ℓ+ℓ−{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}0 jets, where the transverse momentum of the lepton pair is measured. Generalized FJFs are relevant for the analysis of semi-inclusive processes where the full momentum of a hadron, fragmenting from a jet with constrained invariant mass, is measured. Their significance is shown for the example of e                +                e                −{\thinspace}{\textrightarrow}{\thinspace}dijet{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}h, where the perpendicular momentum of the fragmenting hadron with respect to the thrust axis is measured.},

@article{Bain:2016,
	Abstract = {We study jets with identified hadrons in which a family of jet-shape variables called angularities are measured, extending the concept of fragmenting jet functions (FJFs) to these observables. FJFs determine the fraction of energy, z, carried by an identified hadron in a jet with angularity, $\tau$                                                  a                . The FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation functions (FFs), evolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable matching coefficients. Renormalization group equations are used to provide resummed calculations with next-to-leading logarithm prime (NLL') accuracy. We apply this formalism to two-jet events in e                                +                                e                                − collisions with B mesons in the jets, and three-jet events in which a J/$\psi$ is produced in the gluon jet. In the case of B mesons, we use a phenomenological FF extracted from e                                +                                e                                − collisions at the Z                                0 pole evaluated at the scale $\mu$ = m                                                  b                . For events with J/$\psi$, the FF can be evaluated in terms of Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) matrix elements at the scale $\mu$ = 2m                                                  c                . The z and $\tau$                                                  a                 distributions from our NLL' calculations are compared with predictions from monte carlo event generators. While we find consistency between the predictions for B mesons and the J/$\psi$ distributions in $\tau$                                                  a                , we find the z distributions for J/$\psi$ differ significantly. We describe an attempt to merge PYTHIA showers with NRQCD FFs that gives good agreement with NLL' calculations of the z distributions.},

The measurement is performed using data with an integrated luminosity of 36 pb−1. Jets are reconstructed and their momentum measured using calorimetric information. The momenta of the charged particle constituents are measured using the tracking system. The distributions corrected for detector effects are compared with various Monte Carlo event generators and generator tunes. Several of these choices show good agreement with the measured fragmentation function. None of these choices reproduce both the transverse profile and fragmentation function over the full kinematic range of the measurement.},

The integrated and differential cross sections as a function of the pseudorapidity of the lepton from the W-boson decay are measured. Results are compared to the predictions of next-to-leading-order QCD calculations obtained from various parton distribution function parameterisations. The ratio of the strange-to-down sea-quark distributions is determined to be                                                                           {\$} 0.96{\_}{\{}-0.30{\}}^{\{}+0.26 {\}} {\$}                 at Q                2 = 1.9 GeV2, which supports the hypothesis of an SU(3)-symmetric composition of the light-quark sea.

	Abstract = {Prompt D meson and non-prompt J/$\psi$ yields are studied as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in inelastic proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of                                                                                                                                             s                                            =                      7                                                        {\$}{\$} {\backslash}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=7 {\$}{\$}                 TeV. The results are reported as a ratio between yields in a given multiplicity interval normalised to the multiplicity-integrated ones (relative yields). They are shown as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles normalised to the average value for inelastic collisions (relative charged-particle multiplicity). D0, D+ and D*+ mesons are measured in five p                                T intervals from 1 GeV/c to 20 GeV/c and for |y| < 0.5 via their hadronic decays. The D-meson relative yield is found to increase with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. For events with multiplicity six times higher than the average multiplicity of inelastic collisions, a yield enhancement of a factor about 15 relative to the multiplicity-integrated yield in inelastic collisions is observed. The yield enhancement is independent of transverse momentum within the uncertainties of the measurement. The D0-meson relative yield is also measured as a function of the relative multiplicity at forward pseudo-rapidity. The non-prompt J/$\psi$, i.e. the B hadron, contribution to the inclusive J/$\psi$ production is measured in the di-electron decay channel at central rapidity. It is evaluated for p                                T > 1.3 GeV/c and |y| < 0.9, and extrapolated to p                                T > 0. The fraction of non-prompt J/$\psi$ in the inclusive J/$\psi$ yields shows no dependence on the charged-particle multiplicity at central rapidity. Charm and beauty hadron relative yields exhibit a similar increase with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are compared to PYTHIA 8, EPOS 3 and percolation calculations.                                                                                                    },

Differences between quark and gluon jets are discussed as well asQ2-dependent scaling violation effects.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of the suppression of high- p T particles and the away-side jets from heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have shown that medium-induced energy loss affects partons produced in the early stage of a heavy-ion collision. At LHC energies the initial production cross-section is much higher, which allows jets to be reconstructed with a wide kinematic range. Measuring fully reconstructed jets by taking advantage of the ALICE Electromagnetic Calorimeter allows for a more differential investigation of the parton energy loss. Parton energy loss will allow us to access key observables of the hot, dense matter created in heavy ion collisions. The data presented was collected during the 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb runs, as well as baseline measurements from the 2.76 TeV pp run. The procedures used to reconstruct jets and extract them from a fluctuating background will be discussed. The procedure for quantifying the background with a limited acceptance will also be discussed. These results are compared to pp measurements and simulations.},

	Abstract = {Reconstruction of jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is challenging due to the large and fluctuating background coming from the underlying event. We report results on full jet reconstruction, obtained from data collected in 2011 by the ALICE detector at LHC for Pb-Pb collisions at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-6596/446/1/012005/jpconf13_446_012005_eqn002.gif] = 2.76 TeV. The analysis makes use of the tracking system and the electromagnetic calorimeter. Signal jets, which come from hard scattered partons, are reconstructed using the anti- k T jet finder algorithm. The average background is subtracted on a jet-by-jet basis to reduce the contribution to the jet reconstructed energy coming from the underlying event. The jet spectrum is corrected to account for fluctuations in the background momentum density and detector effects through unfolding.},

	Abstract = {The area of a jet is a measure of its susceptibility to radiation, like pileup or underlying event (UE), that on average, in the jet's neighbourhood, is uniform in rapidity and azimuth. In this article we establish a theoretical grounding for the discussion of jet areas, introducing two main definitions, passive and active areas, which respectively characterise the sensitivity to pointlike or diffuse pileup and UE radiation. We investigate the properties of jet areas for three standard jet algorithms, k t , Cambridge/Aachen and SISCone. Passive areas for single-particle jets are equal to the naive geometrical expectation π R 2 , but acquire an anomalous dimension at higher orders in the coupling, calculated here at leading order. The more physically relevant active areas differ from π R 2 even for single-particle jets, substantially so in the case of the cone algorithms like SISCone with a Tevatron Run-II split-merge procedure. We compare our results with direct measures of areas in parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and find good agreement with the main features of the analytical predictions. We furthermore justify the use of jet areas to subtract the contamination from pileup.},

@article{Salam:2007,
	Abstract = {Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only existing approach takes N 2 N time to find jets among N particles, making it unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N 2 ln N time, leading to code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any ` R sep ' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some multi-jet observables.},
