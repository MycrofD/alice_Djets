\section{Software}

The main analysis tasks (\texttt{C++} classes) used in the analysis are in the \texttt{PWGJE} library of the \texttt{AliPhysics} software package:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{AliAnalysisTaskSEDmesonsFilterCJ} (filters D mesons and creates a set of particles with the D meson instead of the daughters);
\item \texttt{AliAnalysisTaskFlavourJetCorrelations} (correlates each D meson found with a jet);
\item \texttt{AliEmcalJetTask} ;%(what does this do?)
\item \texttt{AliAnalysisTaskRhoSparse}. %(what does this do?)
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{AliPhysics} version used for this analysis is the analysis tag: \texttt{vAN-20170826} (with \texttt{AliRoot v5-09-14-1}).%versions have to be updated

The task used for this analysis generates a multiple axis histogram (\texttt{THnSparse}) that keeps information about: \zpar, jet \pt, D-meson \pt\ and D-meson invariant mass.

The post-processing includes: projection of the \texttt{THnSparse} onto lower-dimensional histograms, raw signal extraction, response matrix generation, unfolding, B feed-down correction and the final plotting.
The post-processing is relatively light-weight and is performed directly in a personal computer. This code is written using the \texttt{C++} with \texttt{ROOT}.

%The code is fully available in a \texttt{GIT} repository hosted on the CERN \texttt{Gitlab} service: 
%\url{https://gitlab.cern.ch/saiola/alice-yale-hfjet}. In particular the code is organized as follows:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \texttt{DMesonJetAnalysis}: main post-processing software (tree projection, raw signal extraction, unfolding);
%\item \texttt{fastSimulation}: scripts to run fast simulations locally or on the grid (used for the estimation of the B feed-down correction);
%\item \texttt{merging}: scripts to merge and download results from the grid;
%\item \texttt{anaDev}: scripts to test the analysis tasks.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset and Event Selection}

For this analysis we use the data collected by ALICE in 2016 during the Minimum Bias period of the \pPb\ collisions at $\snn=5.02$~TeV. This data corresponds to the following data taking periods:
LHC16q and LHC16t pass1, FAST and CENT\_woSDD productions were merged.
The complete list of runs used in this analysis are:

LHC16q: 265525, 265521, 265501, 265500, 265499, 265435, 265427, 265426, 265425, 265424, 265422, 265421, 265420, 265419, 265388, 265387, 265385, 265384, 265383, 265381, 265378, 265377, 265344, 265343, 265342, 265339, 265338, 265336, 265335, 265334, 265332, 265309  \\
LHC16t: 267166, 267165, 267164, 267163 

Events were selected using the event selection \texttt{kINT7}. Note that the analysis is performed in \texttt{AOD}, where the beam-gas and gas-gas events have been filtered out.
Events were further filtered using the Physics Selection, and selection provided by:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{AliAnalysisTaskEmcal::IsEventSelected()}, which rejects events based on event vertex quality, in particular requiring a reconstructed vertex position not farther than 10 cm from the center of the detector along the beam axis; and a distance between the SPD vertex and the V0 vertex not larger than 0.5 cm %($2.75+8.66+34.41+29.74$~M~$=75.56$~M events rejected);
\item \texttt{AliRDHFCutsDStartoKpipi::IsEventSelected(AliVEvent*)}, which rejects events for D$^*$ candidates based on event vertex quality and pileup
\item \texttt{AliRDHFCutsD0toKpi::IsEventSelected(AliVEvent*)}, which rejects events for D$^0$ candidates based on event vertex quality and pileup.
%($0.68+1.90+3.71+3.03$~M~$= 9.32$~M events rejected) 
%and pileup 
%($0.09+1.07+1.65+1.18$~M~$ =  3.99$~M events rejected).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}

The total number of events is 603.1 M (after all the selections outlined below) out of 834.5 M analysed.
Results shown in this Note come from the LEGO trains HFCJ\_pPb: \\343 (LHC16q\_pass1\_FAST), 344 (LHC16q\_pass1\_CENT\_woSDD), 345 ( LHC16t\_pass1\_FAST) and 346 (LHC16t\_pass1\_CENT\_woSDD).

\subsection{\Dzero-tagged jets}

The total number of events is  M (after all the selections outlined below) out of  analysed.
Results shown in this Note come from the LEGO train HFCJ\_pPb 438 (LHC16q\_pass1\_FAST, LHC16q\_pass1\_CENT\_woSDD, LHC16t\_pass1\_FAST, LHC16t\_pass1\_CENT\_woSDD) and LEGO train 446 for the cut variation studies.

\subsection{Monte Carlo productions}

For this analysis the Monte Carlo production LHC17d2a\_fast\_new has been used, anchored to the 2016 \pPb\ data taking periods LHC16q and LHC16t and the FAST production. The FAST production simulation is used to corrected the data sample, which is merged FAST+CENT\_woSDD, assuming that efficiencies are detector response are the same for both.
The simulations uses PYTHIA6 with the Perugia2011 tune as particle generator at $\s=5.02$~TeV. If $N_{coll} > $ 1, the event generated by Hijing is also embedded.
The charm content has been enhanced by requesting a \ccbar\ in 50\% of the events and a \bbbar\ in the remaining half.
Furthermore, all D mesons are forced to decay hadronically.
This MC production is used to compute the D-meson efficiency with jets, acceptance corrections and a response matrix of D-tagged jets with prompt and non-prompt \Dstar\ \Dzero\ : c,~b~$\rightarrow$~\Dstar\ ~\Dzero\ .

\section{D-Meson Selection}
\label{sec:DmesonSel}
The \Dstar mesons were reconstructed through their hadronic decay channels~\cite{PDG:2016}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Dzero (\bar{\Dzero}) &\to& {\rm K}^{\pm} + \pi^{\mp}  , {\text{ BR}} = 3.93\pm0.04\%\\
\Dstar \to \Dzero + \pi^{\pm} &\to& {\rm K}^{\pm} + \pi^{\mp}  + \pi^{\pm} , {\text{ BR}} = 67.7\pm0.5\%, 3.93\pm0.04\%
\end{eqnarray*}

The selection strategy is based on the topological displacement of the secondary vertex from the primary vertex due to their relatively large lifetime.

The candidate vertices are read from the \texttt{AOD} friend chain \texttt{AliAOD.VertexingHF.root}. A list of topological and kinematic cuts applied for \Dstar\ in \pPb\ collisions at $\snn=5.02$~TeV can be found in Table~\ref{DStarCutspPb} and in Table~\ref{DZeroCutspPb} for \Dzero in the same \pPb collisions at $\snn=5.02$~TeV.
The same quality track selection on the decay products used for the D-meson spectra analysis of the same datasets has been used in this analysis.
For the final jet spectrum we will apply $\ptd> 3$~\GeVc\ on the D mesons. The accepted $|y_{\rm D}|$ range is \pt-dependent, with the upper limit growing from $0.5$ to $0.8$ at $\pt=5$~\GeVc.

\subsection{Particle Identification}

The Particle Identification (PID) of pions and kaons was performed using the information of the specific energy loss 
in the TPC and the time of flight provided by the TOF detector. 
In order to identify a track as a pion or a kaon its TPC \dedx\ and/or time-of-flight were required to be within 3$\sigma$ of the expected values. 
Tracks with no TOF information were identified using only the TPC.
When PID is inconclusive and neither the pion nor the kaon hypothesis can be excluded, tracks compatible with both the hypotheses 
were retained for analysis.

As a result, for the decay $\Dzero (\bar{\Dzero}) \to {\rm K}^{\pm} + \pi^{\mp}$, the ($K\pi$) pair is counted twice with the two possible mass assignments. If the pair does not correspond
to a real D meson, it would add two background entries in the invariant mass histogram, else it 
counts a signal plus a background entry. 
The misidentification rate (i.e. cases in which the wrong mass
hypothesis is accepted while the correct one is rejected) is very small. In this case the signal D meson
is lost and the entry contributes to the background in the invariant mass histogram. In the following $\Dzero$ analysis, $\Dzero$
reflections are defined as pion-kaon pairs that come from the decay of a real $\Dzero$, but with the reflected mass hypothesis.

\section{Jet Reconstruction}

The \texttt{FASTJET}\cite{Cacciari:2012} package was used to reconstruct the jets. 
In particular, the \antikt\ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008c} was employed to reconstruct signal jets. 
This algorithm is infrared-safe (not sensitive to low energy radiations) and collinear-safe (not sensitive to collinear particle splitting).
A resolution parameter of {\textbf{R=0.4}} was used for \Dstar\ in \pPb\, and {\textbf{R=0.3}} was used for \Dzero\ in \pPb.
In the \pPb\ analysis, the \kt\ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2006} was employed to estimate the background. 
For this analysis, only charged tracks are used to reconstructed the jets (\emph{charged jets}).

The set of tracks given as input to the jet finder has the D-meson daughters replaced 
by the 4-momentum of the D-meson candidate (sum of the 4-momenta of the daughters).
The procedure is repeated independently for each D-meson candidate in each event, 
i.e. each candidate is treated as if it were the only one in the event, then (if there is more than one candidate) the procedure
is repeated for each candidate one by one.
This is done because two (or even more) candidates can share the same daughter. 

\subsection{Jet Selection}
Tracks with $\pt>0.15$~\GeVc\ and $|\eta|<0.9$ were included in the jet finding. 
Reconstructed jets with the axis not satisfying $|\etajet|<0.9-R$ were rejected.

\section{Raw Yield Extraction}
\label{sect:raw_yield}

\subsubsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}
We have implemented two methods to extract the D-tagged jet \pt\ distribution. 
In both the methods, the signal in the \Dstar\ invariant mass distribution is fit with a Gaussian distribution for the 
signal and the following function for the background:
% is performed using a Gaussian distribution for the signal and the following function for the background:
\begin{equation}
\label{e_bkgDStar}
f_{\rm bkg} (m) = a (m-m_{\pi})^{0.5}\exp(b (m-m_{\pi})),
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the invariant mass, $a$ and $b$ are free parameters of the fit.
\begin{description}
\item[Direct jet \pt\ extraction] The invariant mass distribution of the D-meson candidates is built for each \ptchjet\ bin and the signal is extracted directly from the fit parameters.
\item[Side-band subtraction in D-meson \pt\ bins] The invariant mass distribution of the D-meson candidates is built for each \ptd\ bin and 
the D-meson candidates that belong to the bins in the signal region $3\sigma$ around the peak position are used to build the peak-region jet \pt\ distribution;
in order to remove the contribution of D-meson background, the jet \pt\ distribution corresponding 
to the side-band region (between $-8\sigma$ and $-5\sigma$ from the left-hand side of the \Dstar\ peak and between $5\sigma$ and $13\sigma$ on the right-hand side) is taken and normalized to the background integral in the signal region, estimated from the fit.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{\Dzero-tagged jets}
For \Dzero\ the fit is performed using a Gaussian distribution for the signal and a power function for the background:
\begin{equation}
\label{e_sigbkgDZero}
f (m) = Ce^{-(\frac{m-m_0}{2\sigma})^2} + am^b,
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the invariant mass, $a$, $b$, C, $m_0$, $\sigma$ are free parameters.

\begin{description}
\item[Side-band subtraction in D-meson \pt\ bins]: in the case of \Dzero, the signal region is defined as $3\sigma$ around the peak position, and the side-band region is between 5$\sigma$ and 9$\sigma$ away from the \Dzero\ peak from both sides.
\end{description}

In addition, the ``reflection`` templates are extracted from the charm-enhanced MC production. The invariant mass distributions for the reflection templates are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:reflectionDZero_Dbin} % and in Fig.~\ref{fig:reflectionDZero_jetbin}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Direct Jet-$p_T$ Extraction Method}
\label{sect:DirectJet}

The D-meson invariant mass is analyzed for each bin of jet \pt. The D-tagged jet raw yields and the relative uncertainties are extracted from the integral of the Gaussian fit function in the signal regions.
The invariant mass distributions in bins of jet \pt\ for \Dstar\ in \pPb\ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_InvMass_Dstar}.

\label{fig:eq_pPb_InvMass_Dstar}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_RSU_raw} shows a summary of the raw signal extraction: yield, relative statistical uncertainty, signal / background ratio and significance.

\label{fig:eq_pPb_RSU_raw}
\end{figure}

The invariant mass distributions shown here are not corrected for the reconstruction efficiencies. This step is discussed in Sec.~\ref{sect:sub_DmesonRecEff}.
The jet \pt\ bins are selected so that the significance of the D signal is above 5$\sigma$.
The reason of the \Dstar\ signal visible in the Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_InvMass_Dstar} below \ptjet\ of 3 \GeVc\ despite the \ptd\ cut above 3 \GeVc\ is a subtraction of the jet background, as it is described in the Sec.~\ref{sBackSub}.
%The final jet \pt\ range for the \pPb\ analysis is 4 $< p_{T} < $ 40 \GeVc. 


\subsection{Side-Band Subtraction Method}
\label{sub_Bin_d_pT}

The D-meson candidates in the signal region ($3\sigma$ around the peak) are used to build a jet \pt\ distribution, which comprises both signal and background D-meson candidates.
Another jet \pt\ distribution is built using candidates with invariant mass that is between $-8\sigma$ and $-5\sigma$ on the left-hand side of the \Dstar\ peak and between $5\sigma$ and $13\sigma$ on the right-hand side.
For \Dzero\ the background region is between $5\sigma$ and $9\sigma$ from the peak.
The normalization is done using the information of the fit integrating the background function inside the signal area. This is done separately and independently for each \ptd\ bin.

\subsection{Method Comparison}

Figure~\ref{fig:pPbCompDirectJetSB_beforeEff} shows a comparison of the raw yields (without the D-reconstruction efficiency applied). 
Jet $p_T$ spectra are checked with two cuts on the D-meson $p_{T}$: $\ptd>2$~\GeVc and $\ptd>3$~\GeVc. Both agree with each other as it is seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:pPbCompDirectJetSB_beforeEff}. 
However, it is more important to cross-check the two methods with different \ptd\ cuts after the efficiency correction is applied, 
as the background at low \ptd\ influences the analysis more, as it is shown later.

\section{Efficiency Correction Procedure}

\subsection{Reconstruction Efficiency}
\label{sect:sub_DmesonRecEff}
The efficiency and acceptance (${\rm Acc} \times \epsilon$) were calculated using Monte Carlo PYTHIA6+GEANT3 simulations anchored to the data.

The efficiency is taken as the ratio of the \ptd\ spectra of the D-tagged generator-level jets for which a matched
D-tagged detector-level jet was found over all the generated D-tagged jets.
For the detector-level jets, the D meson is required to be within the standard fiducial rapidity cuts.
Jets are further requested to have $|\eta_{\rm jet}| < 0.9 - R$, both at generator and detector levels.

\label{fig:eq_pPb_DrecEff}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{eq_pPb_DrecEff_Dstar} and \ref{eq_pPb_DrecEff_Dzero} show the \Dstar\ and \Dzero\ reconstruction efficiencies as a function of \ptd\, 
for prompt and non-prompt D-mesons. Efficiency depends strongly on \ptd\ because of the topological cuts that are relaxed at higher momenta where the combinatorial background is smaller. 
\\In the \Dzero\ case, the shown efficiency is with a cut on \ptchjet\ of $5 < \ptchjet < 50$ \GeVc\ (range of the final \Dzero-tagged jet \pt\ spectrum) at the generator level, applied for both denominator and nominator in the efficiency calculation.

%However a very weak or no dependence on \ptchjet\ is observed for $5<\ptchjet<30$~\GeVc. From the ratios of the efficiencies in \ptchjet\ bins over the entire range, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pp_DrecEff_ptd_ptjet} one can appreciate a hint of a small deviation, on the order of 10-20\%, for low momentum \Dzero\ (\ptd~$<5$~\GeVc) in high momentum jets. However this deviation is not statistically significant, and affects a very small fraction of the D-meson candidates.

\subsection{Efficiency-Corrected Yields}

As discussed in the previous section, the D-meson reconstruction efficiency shows a strong dependence on \ptd\ (but has very weak or no dependence on \ptjet).
Therefore, in order to reduce the dependence on the Monte Carlo simulation for what concerns jet fragmentation and momentum spectral shape,
the efficiency should be applied as a function of the D-meson momentum. In fact, each bin of \ptjet\ has contributions from D mesons with very different \ptd, which have different efficiencies.

\subsubsection{Direct Jet-$p_T$ Extraction Method}

The efficiency-rescaling procedure of the invariant mass distribution $M(\ptjet,\ptd)$ was implemented according to the following formula:
\begin{equation}
M(\ptjet) = \displaystyle\sum_{\ptd}\frac{M(\ptjet,\ptd)}{({\rm Acc} \times \epsilon)_{\ptd}}.
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_Directjet_corrInv_Dstar} shows the \Dstar\ invariant mass distributions for different ranges of \ptchjet, after the efficiency reweighing procedure.
%Figures~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_Directjet_corrInv_Dstar} and \ref{fig:eq_pPb_Directjet_corrInv_Dzero} show the \Dstar\ and \Dzero\ invariant mass distributions 
for different ranges of \ptchjet, after the efficiency reweighing procedure.
%This process can increase the relative statistical uncertainty due to the large weight assigned to low-\pt\ D mesons (low reconstruction efficiency).

%Figure~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_RSU_raw_corrDrec} shows the yield and relative statistical uncertainties of the reconstructed D-tagged jets with the efficiency weighting with the invariant mass fit method. A comparison with ~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_RSU_raw} shows  that the relative statistical uncertainties are increased as a result of the efficiency weighting.

\subsubsection{Side-Band Subtraction Method}
In the side-band method the efficiency correction is applied by rescaling the D-jet background subtracted \pt\ spectra in Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_signBkgJet_Dstar_Dbins} and Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_signBkgJet_Dzero_Dbins}
by 1/(${\rm Acc} \times \epsilon$) in each D-meson \pt\ bin shown in Fig.~\ref{eq_pPb_DrecEff}, where $\epsilon$ is the prompt D-jet reconstruction efficiency.
The distributions are then summed up to obtain the corrected jet \pt\ spectra for D-jets. 
The efficiency corrected jet $p_{T}$ spectra are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_Directjet_corrSum_Dstar} and Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_Directjet_corrSum_Dzero} for \Dstar-jets and \Dzero-jets respectively. And after rebining in Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_Directjet_corrSum_reb}.

and the side band subtraction method for \Dstar-jets with $\ptd>2$~\GeVc\ and $\ptd>3$~\GeVc. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:JetPt_pPb_corrDrec_Dstar} and \ref{fig:JetPt_pPb_corrDrec_Dzero} show a comparison of the efficiency-corrected yields obtained using the direct jet-\pt\ extraction method and the side band subtraction method for \Dstar-jets and \Dzero-jets respectively with $\ptd>2$~\GeVc\ and $\ptd>3$~\GeVc. 
As mentioned before, the direct jet-\pt\ extraction method is sensitive to weighing with low efficiency for low $p_{T}$ D mesons. 
Therefore, discrepancies for higher \ptjet\ ranges between two methods are visible with $\ptd>2$~\GeVc\ cut. 
With $\ptd>3$~\GeVc\ cut the two methods agree very well with each other within the statistical uncertainties.
$\ptd>3$~\GeVc\ cut reduces also uncertainties on the jet spectra for higher \ptjet. 


%Figure~\ref{fig:JetPt_pPb_SBUnc} shows relative statistical uncertanties for the Side-Band subtraction method with $\ptd>2$~\GeVc\ and $\ptd>3$~\GeVc; $\ptd>3$~\GeVc\ cut reduces also uncertainties on the jet spectra for higher \ptjet.

{\textbf{The default method used for the further analysis is the Side Band method}} with $\ptd>3$~\GeVc\ cut. The method is more stable, Gaussian fits perform better when they are done in \ptd\ bins, since in the case of the direct Jet-$p_T$ Extraction Method the different, efficiency scaled, \ptd bins are combined together which may result in non-gaussian shape of the D-meson signal. It is easier to perform the jet spectra analysis with more fine \ptchjet\ binning if needed.

\section{Underlying Event (\pPb\ analysis)}
\subsection{Average Background Momentum Density}
\label{sBackSub}

The Underlying Event (UE) affects the reconstructed jet momentum and needs to be subtracted.
The average background density $\rho$ is calculated on an event-by-event basis:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq_rho_pPB}
\rho_{\rm p-Pb} = {\rm median}\left\{\frac{p_{\rm T,jet}^{\kt}}{A_{\rm jet}^{\kt}}\right\} C.
\end{equation}
where $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\kt}$ and $A_{\rm jet}^{\kt}$ are respectively the transverse momentum and the area of
the jets found using the \kt\ algorithm. 
The jet area is estimated by \texttt{FASTJET} using the active ghost method, with a ghost area of $0.005$.
The two leading jets in the event are excluded in order to remove the hard scattering jets from the background.
This approach has been used extensively in jet reconstruction analyses~\cite{ALICE:2014a, ALICE:2015a}.
The corrected jet transverse momentum \ptchjetcorr\ is obtained by subtracting the average background density times the jet area:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_jet_backsub}
\ptchjetcorr = \ptchjetraw - \rho A_{\rm jet}.
\end{equation}
For \pPb\ collisions a procedure that takes into account sparse environment with the factor $C$, which is the occupancy correction factor, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_Cfac}
C = \frac{\sum_{j}A_{j}}{A_{\rm acc}}.
\end{equation}
$A_{j}$ is the area of each \kt\ jet with at least one real track (i.e. excluding ghosts), $A_{\rm acc}$ is the area of charged-particle acceptance.

Figure~\ref{fig:rho_Dstar} presents $\rho$ distributions calculated in events that include D-jet candidates (the analysed events), and requiring that an event is with the leading jet that has $p_{T}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, for 0-10\% (left) and 20-40\% (right) centrality. The distributions are compared to $\rho$ from events where a presence of D meson within a jet is not required (called inclusive-jet events).

\label{fig:rho_Dstar}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Jet Background Fluctuations}
\label{sec:BackFluc}
The amount of the jet background fluctuation was evaluated using the Random Cone method.
This method consists in generating a random direction in $\eta-\phi$ inside the jet detector acceptance and 
taking all tracks in the event that satisfy $\Delta R<R_{\rm cone}$ with $R_{\rm cone}$ equal to the resolution parameter used in the analysis. 
The raw cone \pt\ is the sum of the transverse momenta of all particles within the cone.
The background fluctuation \deltapt\ is calculated as shown in Eq.~\ref{edeltapt}, using events that include D-jet candidates excluding the leading jet in an event, and with a requirement that an event is with the leading jet $p_{T}>$ 5 GeV/$c$. The leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event.
The $\delta \pt$ distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DeltaPt_Dstar} and Fig.~\ref{fig:DeltaPt_Dzero} on the left panels for \Dstar-jets and for \Dzero-jets, respectively. 
$\delta \pt$ distributions obtained applying different conditions are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:sysUnc_bkgFluctuations}.
Based on this distribution, a background fluctuation matrix is built which is then, together with the detector response matrix, used to unfold the measured D-jet \pt\ spectrum. 
The background fluctuation matrices are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DeltaPt_Dstar} and Fig.~\ref{fig:DeltaPt_Dzero} (right panels) for \Dstar-jets and for \Dzero-jets, respectively. 

\begin{equation}
\deltapt = p_{\rm T, cone} - \rho \pi R_{\rm cone}^{2}

\section{Jet Momentum Detector Response}

The detector response is studied with a Monte Carlo simulation in which particles generated by an event generator are
run through a transport code (GEANT3), that simulates the response of the detector elements, and then the same event reconstruction used in data is performed. Only \ccbar\ events are used.

Two sets of jets are obtained from the same event. One of them is obtained from the generator-level information and the second from the reconstructed signals after the detector simulation. 
The generated and reconstructed jets are matched by looking for the same D meson at both levels (using its MC label).


\subsection{Detector Response Matrix}
\label{Det_Resp}

The detector response matrices for prompt and non-prompt \Dstar-jets is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fRMdet_pPb} and for \Dzero-jets in Fig.~\ref{fig:fRMdet_pPb_Dzero}.
The Monte Carlo production is with Hijing. However, in order to avoid Hijing imperfection of describing the underlying event, 
only the Pythia part of the production is used to extract the detector response matrix, and the background fluctuations matrix is obtained from data~\ref{sBackFluc}.

For both the \Dstar-jets and \Dzero-jets, their respective prompt detector response matrices are used to unfold the measured D-jet \pt\ spectra after subtraction of the B feed-down component. 
For each D-jet, the B feed-down is estimated based on simulations, as described later, that is folded with the presented non-prompt detector response matrix combined with the background fluctuation matrix.

\section{Feed-Down Correction}
\label{sec:FD}

A fraction of the measured D mesons originates from the decays of B mesons. These D mesons are usually referred to as non-prompt,
to distinguish them from the prompt fraction, i.e. the ones that come directly from the fragmentation of a charm quark or decays of higher excited charm states.
The longer decay length of B mesons combined with the topological cuts applied in the D meson selection causes the reconstruction efficiency 
to be higher for the non-prompt fraction compared to the prompt fraction. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eq_pPb_DrecEff}.
As a consequence, the admixture of the prompt and non-prompt $D-jets$ is biased in a detector-specific way towards the non-prompt.
In order to make meaningful comparisons with theoretical and other experimental results one needs to either correct the bias or remove completely the non-prompt fraction and report only the prompt fraction. 
Both approaches require to use theoretical models or Monte Carlo simulations.
In ALICE the second approach has been preferred so far, and for this analysis we decided to follow it.

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation}

For the D-meson spectra analysis, ALICE has used FONLL~\cite{Cacciari:1998} calculations to estimate the non-prompt fraction~\cite{ALICE:2012d, ALICE:2014d, ALICE:2016a}.
In this analysis however we need to extract the B feed-down fraction also as a function of the jet kinematics, therefore this approach is not applicable.
We decided to use POWHEG~\cite{Alioli:2010}, a Monte Carlo event generator known to reasonably reproduce FONLL calculations and previous experimental results~\cite{Cacciari:2012b}.
The second part of the parton shower and the fragmentation into hadrons is provided by PYTHIA6 (Perugia-2011 tune). In addition a boost was applied in order to account for an asymmetric \pPb\ collision system. 

%We generated 25 M \ccbar\ events and 25 M \bbbar\ events for the baseline parameters: 
%$m_{\rm c} = 1.5$~\GeVcsq, $m_{\rm b} = 4.75$~\GeVcsq, $\mu_{\rm R} = \mu_{\rm F} =\mu_{0} = \sqrt{m^2+\pt^2}$,
%where $m_{\rm c}$ and $m_{\rm b}$ are receptively the charm and beauty masses, $\mu_{\rm R}$ and $\mu_{\rm F}$ are respectively the renormalization and factorization scale factors.  Used based PDF set is: CT10NLO and nPDF: EPS09NLO.
%Figures~\ref{fig:pp_POWHEGvsFONLL_ccbar} and~\ref{fig:pp_POWHEGvsFONLL_bbbar} show a comparison of the D-meson spectra generated by POWHEG+PYTHIA with a FONLL calculation, for \ccbar\ and \bbbar\ events respectively.


We generated 25 M \bbbar\ events for the baseline parameters: 
$m_{\rm b} = 4.75$~\GeVcsq, $\mu_{\rm R} = \mu_{\rm F} =\mu_{0} = \sqrt{m^2+\pt^2}$,
where $m_{\rm b}$ is the beauty masses, $\mu_{\rm R}$ and $\mu_{\rm F}$ are respectively the renormalization and factorization scale factors.  Used based PDF set is: CT10NLO and nPDF: EPS09NLO.
Variation of the simulation parameters are a source of the B feed-down subtraction systematic uncertainties.


The reconstruction of D-meson jets is performed in the POWHEG+PYTHIA6 events using the same procedure used for the main data analysis.

\subsection{Feed-Down Subtraction}
The B feed-down (FD) is subtracted from the measured D-meson jet \pt\ spectra by scaling the cross-section of D-meson jets obtained from the analysis of the POWHEG+PYTHIA simulation by the integrated luminosity of the analyzed data, according to Eq.~\ref{eq:bFDsub}:
\begin{equation}
N^{\rm c\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptchjetdet) = 
N^{\rm c,b\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptchjetdet) - 
R_{\rm det}^{\rm b\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptchjetdet,\ptchjetgen) \otimes \sum_{\ptd} \frac{\epsilon^{\rm b\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptd)}{\epsilon^{\rm c\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptd)} N^{\rm b\rightarrow\Dstar}_{\rm POWHEG}(\ptd,\ptchjetgen),
\label{eq:bFDsub}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N^{\rm c\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptchjetdet)$ is the efficiency-corrected measured yield after FD subtraction; 
\item $N^{\rm c,b\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptchjetdet)$ is the efficiency-corrected measured yield before FD subtraction;
\item $R_{\rm det}^{\rm b\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptchjetdet,\ptchjetgen)$ is the detector response matrix of the \pt\ of non-prompt \Dstar-jets;
\item the symbol $\otimes$ is to be interpreted as the standard product of the response matrix times the vector of the yields in bins of \ptchjetgen;
\item $\epsilon^{\rm c\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptd)$ and $\epsilon^{\rm b\rightarrow\Dstar}(\ptd)$ are respectively the reconstruction efficiencies of prompt and non-prompt \Dstar\ mesons;
\item $N^{\rm b\rightarrow\Dstar}_{\rm POWHEG}(\ptd,\ptchjetgen)$ is the cross-section of \Dstar-jets from the POWHEG simulation scaled by the integrated luminosity of the analyzed data.
\end{itemize}
Since the measured yields are corrected for the prompt D-jet efficiency, the The POWHEG D-jet spectrum is weighted with the ratio of the non-prompt over the prompt D-jet efficiency in D-meson \pt\ bins.

The same procedure is applied in the \Dzero-jet analysis.

%Projections of prompt and non-prompt \Dstar-jets response matrices in slices \ptchjetgen are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pPbres_prompt_nonprompt}. There are small differences between the prompt and non-prompt response seen. 
There are differences between the prompt and non-prompt response, for this reason the FD has to be subtracted before unfolding the measured spectrum; furthermore, as illustrated in Eq.~\ref{eq:bFDsub}, the spectrum obtained from the POWHEG simulation is smeared using the response of non-prompt D-jets. 
Combined response matrix that is used to fold the simulated non-prompt spectrum is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pPb_ResponseMatrix_nonprompt_Dstar} and Fig~\ref{fig:pPb_ResponseMatrix_nonprompt_Dzero} for \Dstar-jets and \Dzero-jets, respectively.


Figure~\ref{fig:pPbFD_corr} compares the measured \Dstar-jet \pt\ spectrum with the FD spectrum and the subtracted spectrum.
Similar procedure is also employed for \Dzero-jets. % and the combined response matrix used to fold the simulated non-prompt spectrum is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pPb_ResponseMatrix_nonprompt_Dzero}
Figure~\ref{fig:pPbFD_corr_Dzero} compares the measured \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectrum with the FD spectrum and the subtracted spectrum.

\section{Unfolding}
\label{sect:unfResults}

Due to detector finite momentum resolution and tracking inefficiency the jet \pt\ spectra measured as described
in the previous sections are distorted. In addition, in \pPb\ collisions, fluctuations in the background momentum density
introduce additional distortions. These distortions are detector-specific and do not allow a direct comparison
with theoretical models and other independent experimental results.

In order to correct for these distortions, we first need to assess the detector performance and quantify
the detector response to the D-meson jets. In addition, for the \pPb\ analysis the background fluctuations are quantified in a
fully data-driven fashion.

In \pPb\ the combined matrix used for the jet \pt\ spectra unfolding is built by multiplying the detector and background fluctuation matrices.
Then the matrix is rebinned according to the binning used for the final jet \pt\ spectra. The combined response matrix, a distribution used as a prior and the corrected jet \pt\ spectrum obtained from the data are passed to the unfolding algorithm. The algorithm returns an unfolded jet \pt spectrum. As a prior, the spectrum obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation at the generator level is used.

\subsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}
Figure~\ref{fig:pPb_ResponseMatrix} shows a combined response matrix for \Dstar-jets.
The corrected for the reconstruction efficiency and B feed-down jet \pt\ spectra before the unfolding (blue) and after the unfolding (red), for the side-band method, are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:UnfSpec_pPb}
Unfolding is done with Bayesian and SVD (see~\ref{sUnfoldSys}) techniques using the \texttt{RooUnfold} software package. The default method is the Bayesian with five iterations. The green line represents folded back spectrum, and is compared to the measured jet spectrum before unfolding with different iterations in the Bayes unfolding - right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:UnfSpec_pPb}, a considered in the analysis jet \pt\ range is above 5 GeV/$c$.
Comparison of unfolded spectra with different methods and priors is presented in the systematic uncertainties section.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}

We considered the following sources of systematic uncertainties:

\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Raw yield extraction
& D-Meson Selection Cuts
& B Feed-Down
& Unfolding and background fluctuation matrix
& Tracking Efficiency
& \pt\ Shape of the Monte Carlo Spectrum
\end{easylist}

\subsection{Raw Yield Extraction}
The stability and systematics of the raw yield extraction has been assessed using the \texttt{MultiTrial} framework developed by the D2H group.
This framework performs the fit of the invariant mass distribution many times varying several conditions, such us binning, fixed vs. free parameters,
background function, fit range.

\subsubsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}

The following variations were included in the assessment of the systematics for the raw yield extraction of \Dstar\ jets in \pPb:
\begin{itemize}
\item fixed $\sigma=\sigma_{\rm MC}$;
\item fixed $\sigma=1.15\sigma_{\rm MC}$
\item fixed $\sigma=0.85\sigma_{\rm MC}$
\item free $\sigma$ and fixed $m_{0}=m_{\rm PDG}$;
\item fixed $\sigma=\sigma_{\rm MC}$ and $m_{0}=m_{\rm PDG}$;
\item free $\sigma$ and free $m_{0}$;
\item background functions: power-law and power-law $\times$ exponential;
\item lower limit of fit range: $0.140$, $0.142$~\GeVcsq;
\item upper limit of fit range: $0.158$, $0.160$~\GeVcsq;
\item rebin by factor 2
\end{itemize}
Figure~\ref{fig:AverageRawYieldVsDefault_pPB} shows the average of the yields obtained in each of these variations compared with the yields obtained with default fit settings as outlined in Section~\ref{sect:raw_yield}.
The systematic uncertainties are calculated as the root-mean-square of all the yields obtained in the multi-trial fits and are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:MultiTrialRMS_pPB}.

\subsubsection{\Dzero-tagged jets}

TO BE ADDED

\subsection{D-Meson Selection Cuts}
Uncertainties of the D-meson cut selection is estimated by varying applied in the analysis D-meson selection criteria, as reported in~\ref{sec:DmesonSel}. 

\subsubsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}

Four variations are considered, two looser sets and two tighter sets of cuts with $\pm$10\% and $\pm$15\% variation from a default cut value. Raw \Dstar-jet \pt\ distributions with these different cut sets and corresponding \Dstar-jet efficiencies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:JetPtRawSys}, and ratios in Fig.~\ref{fig:JetPtRawSysRatio}.

Corrected for the corresponding efficiency \Dstar-jet \pt\ distributions are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:JetPtSys}.

\subsubsection{\Dzero-tagged jets}

7 variations of cut selection are considered, 4 looser sets and 2 tighter sets of cuts. The variations are choose so that they vary \Dzero reconstruction efficiency to high enough extend so that a possible imperfection in MC simulation can be probe. Though at high \ptd\ the selection criteria are already rather loose.
Raw \Dzero-jet \pt\ distributions with these different cut sets and corresponding \Dzero-jet efficiencies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:JetPtRawSys_Dzero}, and ratios to the default set of cuts in Fig.~\ref{fig:JetPtRawSysRatio_Dzero}.

Systematic uncertainties are estimated by taking ratio of the efficiency-corrected, FD subtracted and unfolded \Dzero-jet \ptchjet\ distributions with different cut variations to the \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectrum obtained with the default cut set and taking RMS of them, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:JetPtSys_Dzero}.

\subsection{B Feed-Down Correction}

The B Feed-Down (FD) cross section is obtained from a POWHEG+PYTHIA6 simulation, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:FD}.
In order to assess the systematic uncertainty the same simulation is performed with different choices of the quark mass $m_{\rm b}$, the factorization scale factor $\mu_{\rm F}$, and the renormalization scale factor $\mu_{\rm R}$.
Table~\ref{tab:FDpars} shows the list of parameters used to determine the central points and the variations used to determine the systematic uncertainty.

\subsubsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}

Figures~\ref{fig:BFeedDown_DPtSpectrum_GeneratorLevel_DPtSpectrum} and~\ref{fig:BFeedDown_DPtSpectrum_GeneratorLevel_JetSpectrum} compare the cross sections obtained with the various choices of parameters listed in Table~\ref{tab:FDpars}, respectively as a function of \ptd\ and \ptchjet. %The most extreme variations differ up to 20-30\% from the central points.
The \ptchjet\ distribution is with the analysis cut on \ptd\: 3-36 GeV/$c$, and scaled by non-prompt to prompt efficiency ratio.

Figures~\ref{fig:BFeedDown_GeneratorLevel_Spectrum_canvas} shows the final differential cross sections as a function of \ptchjet\ with systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties are obtained by taking the largest upward and downward variation from the central point in each bin. In this Figure uncertainties are therefore asymmetric. For the FD subtraction the largest between the upward and downward uncertainty is used in order to have a symmetric uncertainty.

The \ptchjet\ distribution is with the analysis cut on 3 $< \ptd <$ 36 GeV/$c$, ratios before scaling by non-prompt to prompt efficiency are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BFeedDown_JetPtSpectrum_Dzero}.

\subsection{Unfolding}
\label{sUnfoldSys}

\subsubsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}

Figure~\ref{fig:unfBayesReg_pPb} shows how the unfolded  \Dstar-jet\ spectrum in \pPb\ collisions evolves with increasing number of iterations, and ratios of folded spectra with different iterations to the default iteration.
Fig.~\ref{fig:unfSVDReg_pPb} presents unfolded jet spectrum from the SVD method~\cite{Hocker:1995} on the left, and the right plot shows ratio of folded to measured spectra with different iterations.
For the systematic uncertainty estimation also priors used for unfolding are varied. The baseline prior used for unfolding is the spectrum obtained (at generator level) from PYTHIA.
For the variations, the spectra were obtained from a modified power-law function:
\begin{equation}
f(\ptjet) = \ptjet^{-a}e^{-\frac{ab}{\ptjet}},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the power-law index (we used two variations: $a=3,6$) and $b=3$~\GeVc\ is the position of the local maximum of the distribution. The exponential factor $e^{-\frac{ab}{\ptjet}}$ was added
to avoid infinities at zero and have a more realistic spectrum (the physical cross-section goes to zero for $\ptjet \to 0$).

Figure~\ref{fig:unfcomparison} compares the unfolded results obtained starting from three different priors in the Bayesian iterative method: PYTHIA spectrum, modified power-law with indexes $3$ and $6$ with 5 iterations, in the Bayesian iterative method with 8 iterations, and unfolded spectrum obtained using SVD with 5 iterations. Figure~\ref{fig:unfcomparisonSys} presents ratio of these different unfolded spectra and RMS - systematic uncertainty.

\subsubsection{\Dzero-tagged jets}

Unfolded \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectrum using the Bayesian method with 3 iteration was shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:UnfSpec_pPb_Dzero}, and the evolution of \Dzero-jet spectrum in \pPb\ collisions increasing number of iterations compare to Bayesian unfolding with 3 iterations was shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:unfIterations_pPb_Dzero}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:unfIterations_pPb_Dzero_reg4} shows an evolution of the unfolded spectra using Bayesian method with 4 iterations. The unfolded \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectrum with 4 iterations compared to the measured and refolded spectra are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:UnfSpec_pPb_Dzero_reg4}, and a ratio of the result obtained with 4 iterations to the default 3 iteration is shown on the right panel of the Fig.~\ref{fig:UnfSpec_pPb_Dzero_reg4}.

\label{fig:UnfSpec_pPb_Dzero_reg4}
\end{figure}


The baseline prior used for unfolding is the spectrum obtained (at the generator level) from PYTHIA.
For the variations, the priors were obtained from a modified power-law function:
\begin{equation}
f(\ptjet) = \ptjet^{-a}e^{-\frac{ab}{\ptjet}},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the power-law index and $b$ is the position of the local maximum of the distribution. The exponential factor $e^{-\frac{ab}{\ptjet}}$ was added to avoid infinities at zero and have a more realistic spectrum (the physical cross-section goes to zero for $\ptjet \to 0$).
Used variations are: %(we used two variations: $a=3,6$) 
\begin{itemize}
\item prior0: $a=4.6$ $b=4$~\GeVc\ 
\item prior1: $a=3$ $b=4$~\GeVc\
\item prior2: $a=4$ $b=4$~\GeVc\
\item prior3: $a=5$ $b=4$~\GeVc\
\item prior4: $a=6$ $b=4$~\GeVc\
\item prior5: $a=7$ $b=4$~\GeVc\
\item prior6: $a=4.5$ $b=3$~\GeVc\
\item prior7: $a=4.5$ $b=5$~\GeVc\
\end{itemize}

Example of priors compared to the PYTHIA \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectra at the generator level are shown on Fig
Ratios of the unfolded \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectra with variation of the functions used as priors to the central \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectrum using the Bayesian unfolding with 3 (left) and 4 (right) iterations are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:UnfSpec_pPb_Dzero_priors}.

The default \ptchjet\ ranges for the unfolding procedure are 3 $< \ptchjet< $ 50 both at the generator and reconstructed level \pt\, with over/under flow bins considered in the unfolding procedure, where $p_{T,jet}^{reco}$ is also the range of the measured in the data \Dzero-jet \pt\ spectrum being unfolded. 
As systematic checks the ranges are varied:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3 $<  p_{T,jet}^{reco} < $ 50, 3 $<  p_{T,jet}^{gen} < $ 50 -- \textbf{Default}
\item 3 $<  p_{T,jet}^{reco} < $ 50, 5 $<  p_{T,jet}^{gen} < $ 50

\item 5 $<  p_{T,jet}^{reco} < $ 50, 5 $<  p_{T,jet}^{gen} < $ 50
\end{itemize}

FURTHER CHECKS TO BE ADDED


\subsection{Background fluctuation matrix}
\label{sec:sysUnc_bkgFluctuations}

\subsubsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}
The background fluctuation matrix is determined in a data-driven way using the Random Cone method.
The default background fluctuation \deltapt\ is calculated using events that include \Dstar-jet candidates excluding the leading jet in an event, and with the leading jet in an event with $p_{T}>$ 5 GeV/$c$. Where the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event.
For a systematic uncertainty estimation the \deltapt\ is also calculated with following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events with \Dstar-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone. \textbf{Default}
\item Events with \Dstar-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone.
\item All events with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone.
\item All events with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone.
\end{itemize}

These different distributions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DeltaPtSys} for events with the leading jet $p_{T}>$ 5 GeV/$c$ (left) and 10 GeV/$c$ (right). Based on these \deltapt\ distributions, new background fluctuation matrices are build. They are then used to build a combined prompt response matrix and the measured \Dstar-jet\ \pt spectrum is unfolded. Ratios of the unfolded spectra and RMS are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BkgFlucSys}.

\subsubsection{\Dzero-tagged jets}
The same procedure is followed in the \Dzero-jet analysis, with R=0.3.
In addition to the cases used before, following new requirement are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event. \textbf{Default}
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone, the leading jet is defined as a \Dzero-jet candidate.
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, Random Cone is placed in the perpendicular plane to the leading jet, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event.
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, Random Cone is placed in the perpendicular plane to the leading jet, the leading jet is defined as a \Dzero-jet candidate.
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event.
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone, the leading jet is defined as a \Dzero-jet candidate.
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, Random Cone is placed in the perpendicular plane to the leading jet, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event.
\item Events with \Dzero-jet candidates and with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, Random Cone is placed in the perpendicular plane to the leading jet, the leading jet is defined as a \Dzero-jet candidate.
\item All events with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event. 
\item All events with $p_{T, lead}>$ 5 GeV/$c$, Random Cone is placed in the perpendicular plane to the leading jet, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event.
\item All events with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, excluding the leading jet from the Random Cone, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event. 
\item All events with $p_{T, lead}>$ 10 GeV/$c$, Random Cone is placed in the perpendicular plane to the leading jet, the leading jet is defined as a jet with the highest \pt\ in an event.
\end{itemize}
It gives it total 12 background fluctuations matrices, where the matrix from~\ref{sec:BackFluc} is used as the default in the analysis and the rest of them are used to estimate the systematic uncertainty.

\subsection{Tracking Efficiency}
%For this dataset the uncertainty on the tracking efficiency is estimated to be about 5\%, based on past studies.
Uncertainties on the tracking efficiency affect the measurement in two ways. 

First, it introduces an uncertainty on the D-meson reconstruction efficiency. This was evaluated for the D-meson spectra to be 4-4.5\% (mostly \pt-independent). Since we have verified that the reconstruction efficiency itself does not depend on \ptchjet\ we can assume that our measurement is affected by the same uncertainty.

\subsection{Tracking Efficiency -- Jet Energy Scale}

Tracking efficiency also affects the detector response. To estimate the uncertainty on the final yield, a new detector response has been built where the efficiency has been reduced to 96\% of its normal value, by throwing randomly away 4\% of the reconstructed track in the simulation.
The raw spectrum is unfolded using this modified response matrix and the outcome is compared with the reference result. The resulting systematic uncertainty is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:JESsys} Fig.~\ref{fig:JESsys_Dzero}. As a cross-check of the observed effect the efficiency was also reduced to 95\%, the value used for the previous pp analysis - the found uncertainties agree between the two analysis. 
The three cases, of 4, 5 and 10\% inefficiency are fitted in order to check linearity, the quoted uncertainty is assumed to be symmetric. 
The systematic uncertainty is estimated by fitting the ratio and as the uncertainty the value obtained from the fitted function is used, the final systematic uncertanties are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:JESsys} and Fig.~\ref{fig:JESsys_Dzero}.

\subsection{\pt\ Shape of the Monte Carlo Spectrum}

The \Dstar\ reconstruction efficiency is estimated using a PYTHIA6+GEANT3 simulation.
A possible source of systematic uncertainty is the \ptd\ shape of the Monte Carlo spectrum.
Since the efficiency is calculated as a function of D meson , the shape of the D meson \ptd\ spectrum is compared to FONLL, a parallel studies within the D2H group were performed. In this Monte Carlo production the generated shape and the FONLL shape agree with each other very well. Therefore, no systematic uncertainties from the \ptd\ shape of the Monte Carlo Spectrum are assigned.

%In order to test the magnitude of this uncertainty we started by comparing the \pt\ spectrum obtained from PYTHIA6 with the \pt\ spectrum obtained from a POWHEG+PYTHIA6 simulation.

%The comparisons are shown, for \Dzero\ mesons and \Dzero\ jets, respectively in Fig.~\ref{fig:PYTHIA_POWHEG_DPtSpectrumComparison} and Fig.~\ref{fig:PYTHIA_POWHEG_JetPtSpectrumComparison}.

%The ratios of the PYTHIA6 spectra over the POWHEG+PYTHIA6 have been fit with a fourth-order polynomial in order to smooth out statistical fluctuations. Then, the fit function of the \ptd-spectrum ratio has been used to reweigh all the \Dzero-mesons of the PYTHIA6+GEANT3 simulation. The same weight is applied both at generator level and at detector level in order to probe the sensitivity on the \pt-spectrum shape. The \Dstar\ reconstruction efficiency is recalculated in the reweighed simulation. 
%It is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ReconstructionEfficiencyMCShape}, where it is compared with the PYTHIA6+GEANT3 unweighted case.
%The two efficiencies are almost identical.

%The effect has been propagated to the raw yields and compared to the default one.

\section{Results}

\subsection{\Dstar-tagged jets}

This Section contains a summary of the results.
The  $D^{*+}$-jet \pt-differential cross-section in \pPb\ collisions at $\snn=5.02$~TeV  with all corrections applied (reconstruction efficiency, B feed-down subtraction, unfolding for detector momentum resolution);
The cross-section is calculated according to the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\rm d}^2\sigma}{{\rm d}\eta {\rm d}\pt}=\frac{1}{L_{\rm int}f_{\rm BR}} \frac{N_{\rm D-jets}(\ptjet)}{\Delta\ptjet\Delta\eta},
\end{equation}
where $L_{\rm int}=N_{\rm evt}/\sigma_{\rm inel}$ is the integrated luminosity ($\sigma_{\rm pPb, inel} = 2.09$~b), $f_{\rm BR}$ is the branching
ratio of the D-meson decay channel used in the analysis, $N_{\rm D-jets}(\ptjet)$ is the measured number of D-jets in a given \ptjet\ bin (with all corrections applied).

The $D^{*+}$-tagged jet \pt\ differential cross section in \pPb\ collisions at $\snn=5.02$~TeV is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:pPbJetPt_final}.

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Simulations}
We performed a set of Monte Carlo simulations using POWHEG and PYTHIA6 to compare with our measurement.
The simulations follow the same recipe used for simulating the non-prompt fraction for the B feed-down correction.
We simulated 25 M \ccbar\ events with POWHEG+PYTHIA6 for the central points plus several variations of the parameters of the simulation, listed in Table~\ref{tab:PromptDpars}.

Figures~\ref{fig:PromptDJetsPrediction_DPtSpectrum_GeneratorLevel_DPtSpectrum} and~\ref{fig:PromptDJetsPrediction_JetPtSpectrum_GeneratorLevel_DPtSpectrum} compare the cross sections obtained
with the various choices of parameters listed in Table~\ref{tab:PromptDpars}, respectively as a function of \ptd\ and \ptchjet. 
%The most extreme variations differ up to 50\% from the central points (larger uncertainty compared to the non-prompt cross section).

\subsubsection{Effect of the \ptd\ Cut}
The effect of the \ptd\ cut in the \Dstar-jet differential cross section has been studied in POWHEG+PYTHIA6.
Figure~\ref{fig:PromptDSim_JetSpectraComparison_PtDCut} shows that
the ratio of the cross section for $\ptd>3$~\GeVc\ over inclusive is about $80$\% for $\ptchjet=4$~\GeVc\ and then it raises and reaches a plateau at about $95$\% for $\ptchjet=10$~\GeVc.
